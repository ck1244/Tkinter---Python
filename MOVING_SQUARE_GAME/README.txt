##MOVING SQUARE GAME


The program should play as follows:
- On pressing start, the code will present a red square to the user
- The user must press this square within two seconds to receive a point
- If the user receives a point, the label must update by one to reflect this change
- The square will be redrawn at a new location on the canvas for the user to play again. This will
not happen until the user clicks on the square.
